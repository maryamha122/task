                <p>Al Ahsa topped the book "Creative Cities of the World" issued by the network of creative cities of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), after joining the network in the field of handicrafts and folklore (the first Gulf and the second Arab).</p>
                <p>The book, which was distributed on the occasion of the "Creative Cities Network" conference, was held yesterday in the Swedish city of Ustarland with the participation of Amin Al-Ahsa, Eng. Adel Al-Melhem, and Al Ahsa Coordinator at UNESCO.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the conference, a meeting was held for the secretaries of member cities, and secondary meetings of the participating cities in each of the seven areas identified by the network, as well as exhibitions of the best experiences and practices offered by the participating cities and local festivals of the host city.
Eng. Al-Mulhem said in his speech at the conference: «Ahsa has a creative component, which makes it in the ranks of its counterparts from the countries of the world, which calls for the need to take care of culture heritage, and pulse creative and the development of handicrafts and popular folklore». He pointed out that Ahsa will hold a large celebration and a large carnival of handicrafts and folklore.</p>
<p>The delegation of Al Ahsa dedicated creative and Creative cities as commemorative shields, which are hand-made sculptures inspired by the popular heritage. The most important of these are the Al-Basht Al-Hasawi, as well as gifts from the luxurious Ahsaa heritage.
The delegation also met with a number of city leaders, including Sweden's Ostland, Ansovia Anderson, Sasayama, Japanese Takakasekai, Bokova, Mary Hammond, Etichon of Korea, Subyung Dutt and Fabriano of Italy, where they exchanged experiences and ideas.</p>

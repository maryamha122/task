                <p>The UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) was created in 2004 to promote cooperation with and among cities that have identified creativity as a strategic factor for sustainable urban development. The 116 cities which currently make up this network work together towards a common objective: placing creativity and cultural industries at
                    the heart of their development plans at the local level and cooperating actively at the international level.</p> 
                <p>By joining the Network, cities commit to sharing their best practices and developing partnerships involving the public and private sectors as well as civil society in order to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
strengthen the creation, production, distribution and dissemination of cultural activities, goods and services;</li>
                    <li>develop hubs of creativity and innovation and broaden opportunities for creators and professionals in the cultural sector;</li>
                    <li>improve access to and participation in cultural life, in particular for marginalized or vulnerable groups and individuals;</li>
                    <li>fully integrate culture and creativity into sustainable development plans.</li>
                    <li>The Network covers seven creative fields: Crafts and Folk Arts, Media Arts, Film, Design, Gastronomy, Literature and Music.</li>
                </ul>
